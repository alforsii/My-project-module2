### PROJECT for MODULE 2

When you successfully merged do in the JSON file folder

`npm intall, add cloudinary keys and PORT in the .env and run node bin/seeds.js to get ready users.`
Note: if you make comments with your current user and add posts, and after that
for some reason you delete your user and recreate, it will give your an error.
So in that case delete first comments and posts collection before recreating
your single user!
